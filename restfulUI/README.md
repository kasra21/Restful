# Polymer UI

This template is a starting point for building apps using a drawer-based
layout. The layout is provided by `app-layout` elements of the Polymer App Toolbox - Starter Kit

### Setup

##### Prerequisites

Install [polymer-cli]:

    npm install -g polymer-cli

##### Initialize project from template

    polymer init starter-kit

### Start the development server

This command serves the app at `http://localhost:xxxx` (specified in the terminal) and provides basic URL
routing for the app:

    polymer serve


### Build

This command performs HTML, CSS, and JS minification on the application
dependencies, and generates a service-worker.js file with code to pre-cache the
dependencies based on the entrypoint and fragments specified in `polymer.json`.
The minified files are output to the `build/unbundled` folder, and are suitable
for serving from a HTTP/2+Push compatible server.

In addition the command also creates a fallback `build/bundled` folder,
generated using fragment bundling, suitable for serving from non
H2/push-compatible servers or to clients that do not support H2/Push.

    polymer build

### Preview the build

This command serves the minified version of the app at `http://localhost:xxxx`
in an unbundled state, as it would be served by a push-compatible server:

    polymer serve build/unbundled

This command serves the minified version of the app at `http://localhost:xxxx`
generated using fragment bundling:

    polymer serve build/bundled

### Run unit tests

    polymer test
